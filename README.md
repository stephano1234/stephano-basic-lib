## Purpose
This library aims to provide any front end project with the basic components needed. The components must be easy to use. However, the reason behind this project is my personal development in regards to the knowledge in building useful and reuseable elements for a user interface.
## Description
This is a basic Angular library with some of the components that usually appear in front end projects. The most common are dropdowns, inputs and tables. The only library used on this project was Angular CDK itself.
